            Welcome to my website. I am excited you are here to learn more about
            me and what drives my continued success. Born on January 31st, 1989
            in Seoul, South Korea and later adopted by a loving family from
            Southwest Michigan. I grew up in a small farming town and quickly
            fell in love with the outdoors. Everything from camping and
            backpacking to hunting, fishing and rock-climbing. As an adventurer
            and a pilot, I have developed a very unique skill-set which helps
            propel my life, both professionally and personally. I utilize
            dedication, discipline, integrity and excellence; in all I do.
